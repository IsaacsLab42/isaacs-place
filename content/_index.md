# Welcome
Welcome to my little blog. This mostly exists for myself as a way to document
my interests and things I've learned. Generally this involves electronics,
software development, woodworking, 3D printing, home repairs, and "making" things.

I didn't want to go full Wordpress, so after looking around some I decided to use
[Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) to build this site. Hugo is a static web site generator
which works great for me. I don't need a lot of fancy stuff, and there is no
backend server to keep updated. The source code for this blog is all in my
[Github repo](https://github.com/IsaacsLab42/isaacs-place). I have
[AWS Amplify](https://aws.amazon.com/amplify/) set up with a build trigger, so that
as soon as I push updates my site is rebuilt and deployed using the Amazon cloud.

As a static site there are no comments. I know that there are 3rd party services
that would allow me to add comments, but honestly I don't see a reason. This is
mostly just for me and my opinions. If you disagree then move on. If you don't
then feel free to link back to me.
