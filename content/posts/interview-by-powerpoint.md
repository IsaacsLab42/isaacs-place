Let's be honest, interviewing for jobs sucks. So far as I've seen there really isn't a way around that.
There are ways to make the process easier and more comfortable, but some companies insist on making it
harder. These companies freely admit this, boasting that only the best work for them. I strongly disagree.

During my career I've sat on both sides of the interview table. Evidently I have an interview style that
differs from many. While I will ask a few technical questions, by far mostly I am interested in getting
a feel for the ambition of the person and their problem solving abilities. Yes, technical prowess is vital
in a technical role. More often than not the employees that fail at their jobs, or get painted into a corner,
can prattle off technical facts, but fail in one of two ways:

1. They can't get along with people
2. They can't adapt and solve new problems

The first should be obvious. Even as a technical person you need to interact with other people. That might
be other team members, customers, managers, technical writers, testers, or any number of other people.
Notice that I said can't get along with people. There is a vast difference between someone who is introverted
and someone who is cantankerous. I'm speaking strictly of the latter.

The second seems obvious, but actually seems to get very little consideration. Two instances come to mind
immediately. Their technical knowledge was on the weak side, but they squeeked past the standardized company
interview. When it came down to it though, they had very little problem solving abilities and required a
lot of handholding to work through problems. So not only did their work suffer, but the work of those who had
to handhold them did. In both cases these were not young college graduates, but "seasoned" engineers.

Likely because of that, and now that I am in a position to set the interview questions, I focus my interviews
a whole lot more on problem solving. Asking for explanations of how they approach problems. Now, given this
proclivity what I'm about to say might at first sound counterintuitive. Stick with me though.

In two job interviews, where I was the one being interviewed, I was asked to create an hour long presentation.
This was to contain my background, summary of education, and examples of real world projects that I've worked
on, my contributions, and the outcomes. So, at first glance this sounds reasonable. But, let's dig a little
deeper.

First, I've met many engineers who are horrible in front of people. They stumble over their words, get
nervous, or have zero social awareness. Yet, they are great engineers. One of my employees fits this description
perfectly. In our first meeting he was shy, mumbled, and came across poorly. Yet he is a savant of an engineer.
I guarantee he would have failed miserably on a PowerPoint about himself, but he's the best engineer that I have.
Any company would be foolish to not want him. (and no, you can't have him)

Another problem with these presentations comes from proprietary information. I've got some serious non-disclosure
agreements binding me, so I would be completely unable to pass one of these interviews. I could maybe pick some
projects from 15-20 years ago, but that looks fishy when interviewing. Technology changes so fast and they want
to see up-to-date competency. Generally interviewees want to impress the interviewer, so maybe they won't think
about implications of non-disclosure agreements and overshare. Maybe they will and talk in high-level generalities.
That might work. But, it might not. It really depends on the company. According to the guidelines I was given
this absolutely would not work. They wanted details, not high level.

I get it. I really do understand why companies find this way of interviewing attractive. It forces the interviewee
into flattening their life into a digestable chunk, rather than making the interviewer ask probing questions.
But, it loses that two-way interaction. Okay, yes there is often a portion set aside for questions.
