In my role in a small company I wear many hats. Primarily I am technical and
do software engineering. I also play benefits manager, general HR, business
development, and as the title might suggest, recruiter.

Since I am technical I receive a lot of recruitment emails, texts, and
phone calls. With all of the messages that I receive I have put together a 
collection of real-world things that recruiters do which instantly turn me
off. I preset this, by way of sarcasm, as a to-do guide.

# The Tongue In Cheek Guide To Hiring

## Do Not Read The Resume
There are some vaguely technical keywords in there, which is obviously what
your search triggered on. Why waste time reading the resume? The candidate
can read your job description and see if it applies to themselves, so you
don't have to. Your time is way more valuable and you shouldn't be
bothered with words anyway. Aren't you late for your golf game?

## Stability? Benefits? Ha! Candidates Seek Adventure!
You actually took more than 10 seconds to read a resume. Pat yourself on the back;
you've done your job. It looks like that candidate has spent the last 6 years
at the same employer, so it's time to offer them some excitement. Clearly
their life has become stagnant with all of those "benefits." Offer them an
hourly 1099 contract job with a rate that would make fast food workers laugh.
For 6-12 months. In another state.

## Use The Canned Linkedin Connection Message
You are very busy! Take care of yourself. There is a reason that LinkedIn offers
canned messages, so just go ahead and use them. Make sure to randomly connect
to everyone. Surely someone with more time than you will read your magnificent
company information and contact you, begging to come work for you.

## Be Blissfully Ignorant Of Time
You've got a position to fill! Your candidates should not deign to work during
the day. Make sure you call and text them, a lot, in the middle of the work day.
Attention to you is top priority. Your candidates will have their attention
stealing cell phone with them at all times and will drop everything at a moments
notice to answer an unknown caller in front of their boss. Make sure to also
text them after calling, as text is how all professionals hire.

## Use Your New Best Friend For Referrals
You did it! You sent them an email with all of the wonderful things there are
about the job. Make sure you let them know that they are in no way special
and you don't actually care if they take a job with you. Milk them for all
they are worth. Get them to refer all of their friends to you, an unknown entity.

## Careers Are For Losers!
You want a warm body. The job requisition is all that matters. Push and sell
that requisition. They have no need to know of trivial drivel like your 
company name, or benefits, or history. The job requisition is king and all
that matters.

# Okay, Don't Actually Do That
Each of the above "rules" is sadly based on real world experience with recruiters.
It really all comes down to some very simple principles:

* Read the resume
* Be respectful of time
* Treat each person as an asset

The recruiters who have been successful in engaging me all did several things right.

First and foremost, good recruiters have an understanding that positions come and go.
People move around in a company. A top notch company culture is far more important
than the position of the week. They sell me on the company.

It's also very obvious whether or not a recruiter has a grasp of the industry and your
particular skill set. Even from initial emails I can tell, if what they say is
tailored to me and not just a canned spew of text.

I understand that recruiters have families, friends, and lives outside of work.
But unfortunately for them after-hours is the best time to talk to people. Respecting
my time and my obligation to my employer goes a long way.

Finally, this is about making a personal connection. When I see a line like "if you
aren't interested but you know someone who is then please send them my way," my
reaction is that this person just wants a warm body, not me. A recruiting email is
not a place to ask for a referral. It's a place to show that you value people
as individuals.
